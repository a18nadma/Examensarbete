            <h1>The Minuscule Hat</h1>
            <p>Alison Khan looked at the minuscule hat in her hands and felt barmy. She walked over to the window and reflected on her old-fashioned surroundings. She had always loved dull West Boggins with its knobby, kindhearted kettles. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel barmy. Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Steve Wishmonger. Steve was a selfish knight with slimy legs and wobbly eyes.</p>
            <p>Alison gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was an energetic, sinister, wine drinker with scrawny legs and dirty eyes. Her friends saw her as an amused, adorable academic. Once, she had even rescued a manky baby flamingo from a burning building. But not even an energetic person who had once rescued a manky baby flamingo from a burning building, was prepared for what Steve had in store today. The rain hammered like partying horses, making Alison calm. As Alison stepped outside and Steve came closer, she could see the flat smile on his face.</p>
            <p>"Look Alison," growled Steve, with an admirable glare that reminded Alison of selfish goldfish. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want a kiss. You owe me 5975 gold pieces." Alison looked back, even more calm and still fingering the minuscule hat. "Steve, I shrunk the kids," she replied. They looked at each other with worried feelings, like two burnt, bulbous badgers skipping at a very splendid wedding, which had indie music playing in the background and two helpful uncles shouting to the beat.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, Steve lunged forward and tried to punch Alison in the face. Quickly, Alison grabbed the minuscule hat and brought it down on Steve's skull. Steve's slimy legs trembled and his wobbly eyes wobbled. He looked surprised, his wallet raw like a repulsive, ripe rock. Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Steve Wishmonger was dead. Alison Khan went back inside and made herself a nice glass of wine.</p>
