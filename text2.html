            <h1>Grand Manchester</h1>
            <p>Fairydust Cox looked at the warped blade in her hands and felt irritable. She walked over to the window and reflected on her creepy surroundings. She had always loved grand Manchester with its evil, empty estuaries. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel irritable. Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Cameron Cox. Cameron was a daring author with slimy moles and fluffy eyebrows.</p>
            <p>Fairydust gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was an intelligent, hopeful, brandy drinker with spiky moles and handsome eyebrows. Her friends saw her as a long, loose lawyer. Once, she had even rescued an adventurous toddler from a burning building. But not even an intelligent person who had once rescued an adventurous toddler from a burning building, was prepared for what Cameron had in store today. The clouds danced like sitting tortoises, making Fairydust worried.</p>
            <p>As Fairydust stepped outside and Cameron came closer, she could see the mashed glint in his eye. "Look Fairydust," growled Cameron, with a popular glare that reminded Fairydust of daring pigeons. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want a fight. You owe me 4944 pounds." Fairydust looked back, even more worried and still fingering the warped blade. "Cameron, I admire your eyebrows," she replied.</p>
            <p>They looked at each other with sleepy feelings, like two grim, grisly giraffes chatting at a very energetic engagement party, which had orchestral music playing in the background and two sympathetic uncles boating to the beat. Fairydust studied Cameron's slimy moles and fluffy eyebrows. Eventually, she took a deep breath. "I'm afraid I declared myself bankrupt," explained Fairydust. "You will never get your money."</p>
            <p>"No!" objected Cameron. "You lie!". "I do not!" retorted Fairydust. "Now get your slimy moles out of here before I hit you with this warped blade." Cameron looked afraid, his wallet raw like a barbecued, burnt book. Fairydust could actually hear Cameron's wallet shatter into 4944 pieces. Then the daring author hurried away into the distance. Not even a glass of brandy would calm Fairydust's nerves tonight.</p>
